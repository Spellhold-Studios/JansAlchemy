Jan's Book of Brewing is a magical tome that will allow Jan to create potions
following specific recipes. Includes 8 new potions, cutscenes and scripts.
No editing is required, just import the iap and load your game with Jan,
he will have his tome and be ready to rock.


=================================================================================


Here are some descriptions and guidelines for using this package.
First, it was set for Jan automatic use, which means you dont need to use cluaconsole, edit, visit a shop or whatever, just load your game and if you have Jan around he should be set to use the scripts and will create his book (havent tested if he had his inventory full, so... avoid it if you can).
Second, as stated in the book, each brewing requires an exact amount of ingredients (being either gems -misc-, scrolls -scrl- and/or other potions -potn-. If you have a different amount of those in Jan's inventory, you'll see him screwing up the recipe. Of course more gold wont ruin it, only less gold than necessary will. Haven't tested with extra ingredients in containers.
Third, many potions are really powerful, but if you play without cheating, you'll see that acquiring the ingredients may be hard sometimes, which should balance it out somewhat, unless you start the game stocking up on ingredients.
Note: use the book in the quickslot to begin brewing, it has 3 charges per day.

Here's some precise effects of each potion:
Note: each potion should warn you when their effects expired; any potion may be used by anyone, though the effects may not be useful for everyone.
